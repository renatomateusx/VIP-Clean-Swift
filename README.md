# VIP-Clean-Swift
Project made as an challenge to show POC with VIP Clean Swift.

# Concept
The VIP Pattern is an VIPER pattern improvment which means that the responsability principle which is broken by VIPER is keepd by VIP Pattern because the logic of
that pattern is unidirectional. You can see image below.<br/>

# Folder Structure
In this project I used the below folder structure. If you pay attention you can add the business logical with ViewModel. But you must keep the unidirectional path. Therefore you'll add on more layer.<br/>
